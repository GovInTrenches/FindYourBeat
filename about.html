	    <h2 id="types">Public Elementary Schools in Oakland</h2>
      <p>There are four types of schools in the Chicago Public School system: neighborhood schools, selective schools, magnet schools, and charter schools. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Neighborhood schools</strong> must enroll any student who lives within their boundary. Every student has a neighborhood school they can go to. Tiers don't matter for enrollment.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Selective schools</strong>, which admit students from across the city, are different. Students must apply to them, and no one is guaranteed a seat because of where they live. Most of the seats are filled through the tier system.</p>
          <p>Selective schools and programs include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href='http://www.cps.edu/Schools/Elementary_schools/Pages/Regionalgiftedcenter.aspx'>Regional Gifted Centers</a></li>
            <li><a href='http://www.cps.edu/Programs/Academic_and_enrichment/SelectiveEnrollment/Pages/Classical.aspx'>Classical Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href='http://www.cps.edu/Programs/Academic_and_enrichment/SelectiveEnrollment/Pages/Academiccenters.aspx'>Academic Centers</a></li>
            <li><a href='http://www.cps.edu/Programs/Academic_and_enrichment/SelectiveEnrollment/Pages/InternationaGiftedProgram.aspx'>International Gifted Programs</a></li>
            <li><a href='http://www.cps.edu/Schools/High_schools/Pages/Selectiveenrollment.aspx'>Selective Enrollment High Schools</a></li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Magnet schools</strong> are in between: they admit students within their boundaries based on a lottery. Any leftover spots are opened up to students citywide based on the tier system, much like a selective school. So nearby students are not guaranteed a seat, but they have much better chance of getting in.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Charter schools</strong> set their own enrollment policies.</p></li>
        </ul>

			<h2 id="zones">Oakland's Option Enrollment & Zones</h2>
      <p>In Chicago, a student's chance of getting into the city's top, selective schools depends on where he or she lives.</p>

      <p>That's because selective schools use admissions quotas: Chicago Public Schools requires the schools to reserve an equal number of spots for students coming from poor and wealthy neighborhoods.<sup>[<a href='#footnote-1'>1</a>]</sup></p>

      <p>If schools didn't do this, students from well-off places would be admitted in disproportionate numbers, because they tend to have better admissions scores.<sup>[<a href='#footnote-2'>2</a>]</sup></p>

      <p>Rightly or wrongly, the quota tries to keep wealthier students from dominating selective schools.</p>

      <p>The result: a high-achieving student from an impoverished area has a better chance of getting into a selective school than a similar student from a richer area.</p>

      <p>Here's some recent coverage of this year's selective admissions:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-03/news/ct-met-cps-selective-20120302_1_seventh-grade-academic-scores-socioeconomic-tiers-selective-enrollment">'A really brutal admissions year'</a> - Chicago Tribune</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.wbez.org/story/chicagos-best-high-schools-who-gets-who-doesnt-97110"</a>Chicago's best high schools: Who gets in, who doesn't</a> - WBEZ</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2 id="data">Where did we get the data?</h2>
      <p>OUSD updates enrollment zones periodically. As a result of recent school closures and the need to adjust zones for these closed schools they released a <a href='http://ousd.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=224993&GUID=63898CAE-13E1-45E8-8FE9-A9D6197BA5C2&Options=info|&Search='>document</a> that details these new zone boundaries. </p>

      <p>OUSD also produces a search <a href='http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/page/323'>tool</a> to help yo ufind schools without the zone information.</p>

      <h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why should I care what zone I'm in?</h2>
      <p>Students can only apply to up to six selective high schools. If they're not accepted by any of those six, they're out of luck.</p>

      <p>Every school changes its cutoff score - the minimum score students need to get in - every year. Still, knowing the <a href="http://cpsmagnet.org/ourpages/auto/2012/3/2/42650967/SEHS%20Cutoff%20Scores%202012-2013.pdf">previous year's cutoff scores</a> can help guide a student's decision of which six schools to apply for.</p>

      <p>The thing is, each school has a different cutoff score for every tier. So it can be helpful to know what tier you live in when figuring out which six schools to apply to.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This map was built using <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.html'>Google Maps</a>, and <a href='http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/'>Google Fusion Tables</a>. The code is open source and has been redeployed from the original application built for Chicago Schools by <a href='http://opencityapps.org'> Open City </a>and is free for anyone to reuse from <a href='https://github.com/spjika/cps-tiers'>github</a>.</li>

      <li id="footnote-1">
        <p>In 1980, Chicago Public Schools and the U.S. Department of Justice signed a consent decree to desegregate the school system, overseen by the U.S. District Court. To carry it out, CPS adopted a racial quota system to govern enrollment in selective schools. In 2009, U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras <a href='http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/notebook/2009/09/24/federal-judge-ends-chicago-schools-desegregation-decree'>ended the consent decree</a>, so that CPS could no longer use a student's race as an admissions factor.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.cps.edu/About_CPS/The_Board_of_Education/Pages/TheChicagoBoardofEducation.aspx'>The Chicago Board of Education</a>, which oversees CPS, quickly adopted the Tier system as a new way of creating social and economic diversity in the city's selective schools.</p></p>

	    <h2 id="types">Public Elementary Schools in Oakland</h2>
      <p>There are two types of elementary schools in the Oakland Unified School District: public elementary schools and charter schools. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Public Elementary schools</strong> must enroll any student who lives within their boundary. Every student has a neighborhood school they can go to. Tiers don't matter for enrollment.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Charter schools</strong> set their own enrollment policies and in Oakland use a lottery system for placement  There is little guarantee that you will get a spot in a Charter simply because you live or move close to one.</p></li>
        </ul>

			<h2 id="zones">Oakland's School Options Program & Enrollment Zones</h2>
      <p>Oakland Unified allows any student to apply to any school in the District.</p>

      <p>The Options Process does not guarantee that every family will be accepted into its first-choice school. It does, however, significantly expand the educational options available for all Oakland families..<sup>[<a href='#footnote-1'>1</a>]</sup></p>

      <p>The goal of this open enrollment practice—called the School Options Program—is to ensure all families have equitable access to high-performing schools across the city.</p>

      <p>If a school has avaialble space, all students who apply will be accepted.</p>

      <p>If there are more students than places the following <a href="http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/cms/lib07/CA01001176/Centricity/Domain/18/EnrollmentOptions_2012-2013_Elementary_ENG_final-web.pdf">criterea</a> are used.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1st priority — Sibling (students who have an older sibling living at the same address who is already attending the applicant’s
first choice school and will be continuing at the school in the Fall of 2013.)</li>
		<li>2nd priority — Neighborhood (students who live in the neighborhood boundary of a school; see mapstacker.ousd.k12.ca.us
for your neighborhood schools)</li>
		<li>3rd priority — Program Improvement School neighborhood (students who live in a neighborhood where the local school(s) is
(are) Program Improvement school(s).</li>
		<li>4th priority — Open lottery.</li>
	</ul>
	
      <p>Here's some recent coverage of this year's boundary changes:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://oaklandnorth.net/2011/12/06/attendance-boundaries-will-change-after-ousd-vote-for-school-closures/">'Attendance boundaries will change after OUSD vote for school closures.'</a> - Oakland North</li>
        <li><a href="http://oaklandlocal.com/article/oakland-unified-changes-attendance-boundaries-some-elementary-schools"</a>'Oakland Unified changes attendance boundaries of some elementary schools.'</a> - Oakland Local</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2 id="data">Where did we get the data?</h2>
      <p>OUSD updates enrollment zones periodically. As a result of recent school closures and the need to adjust zones for these closed schools they released a <a href='http://ousd.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=224993&GUID=63898CAE-13E1-45E8-8FE9-A9D6197BA5C2&Options=info|&Search='>document</a> that details these new zone boundaries. </p>

      <p>OUSD also produces a search <a href='http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/page/323'>tool</a> to help yo ufind schools without the zone information.</p>

      <h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why should I care what zone I'm in?</h2>
      <p>Students can only apply to up to six selective high schools. If they're not accepted by any of those six, they're out of luck.</p>

      <p>Every school changes its cutoff score - the minimum score students need to get in - every year. Still, knowing the <a href="http://cpsmagnet.org/ourpages/auto/2012/3/2/42650967/SEHS%20Cutoff%20Scores%202012-2013.pdf">previous year's cutoff scores</a> can help guide a student's decision of which six schools to apply for.</p>

      <p>The thing is, each school has a different cutoff score for every tier. So it can be helpful to know what tier you live in when figuring out which six schools to apply to.</p>

      <h2 id="tech">How did we make the map? (for the geeks)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This map was built using <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.html'>Google Maps</a>, and <a href='http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/'>Google Fusion Tables</a>. The code is open source and has been redeployed from the original application built for Chicago Schools by <a href='http://opencityapps.org'> Open City </a>and is free for anyone to reuse from <a href='https://github.com/spjika/cps-tiers'>github</a>.</li>
        <li>Our data is also open source. View and download it from Fusion Tables: <a href='https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?docid=1zzlVg7P8-vT0TAqJHquuKmjrj_Znwr0eNFDT0XY'>2013 Zone Boundaries</a>.</li>
        <li>Interested in using Fusion Tables to build quick and easy to use map apps? Check out the source template for this app built by Derek Eder <a href='http://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/'>(template)</a>.</li>
